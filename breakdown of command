# Task 4: Firewall Setup with UFW

## Steps:
1. Installed and enabled UFW.
2. Allowed SSH (port 22).
3. Blocked Telnet (port 23).
4. Tested the block rule using telnet.
5. Removed the block rule.


## Commands Used:

sudo ufw status verbose(ufw status verbose = show firewall rules + detailed firewall settings
is used in Linux to check the status of UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) with detailed information.
)

sudo ufw enable(
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → Uncomplicated Firewall
enable → turn the firewall ON

Turn on the UFW firewall with admin privileges.
)

sudo ufw disable(
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → Uncomplicated Firewall
disable → turn the firewall OFF

Turn off (deactivate) the UFW firewall using admin privileges.
)

sudo ufw allow ssh(
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → Uncomplicated Firewall
allow → permit traffic
ssh → the SSH service (usually port 22)

Allow incoming SSH connections through the firewall.
)

sudo ufw deny 23/tcp(
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → Uncomplicated Firewall
deny → block/deny traffic
23/tcp → port 23 using the TCP protocol (Telnet port)

Block incoming Telnet connections on port 23 over TCP.
)

sudo ufw status numbered(
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → Uncomplicated Firewall
status numbered → show the firewall rules with rule numbers

Display all UFW firewall rules in a numbered list, so you can easily delete specific rules.
)

sudo ufw delete [rule-number](
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → firewall
delete → remove a rule
[rule-number] → number of the rule from status numbered

Delete the firewall rule that matches the given number.
)

sudo ufw delete deny 23/tcp(
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → Uncomplicated Firewall
delete → remove a rule
deny 23/tcp → the specific rule that blocks port 23 (Telnet) over TCP

Remove the firewall rule that was blocking TCP port 23.
)

sudo apt install telnet(
sudo → run as administrator
apt → package manager for Debian/Ubuntu
install → install a package
telnet → the Telnet client program

Install the Telnet client on your Linux system.
)

telnet localhost 23(
telnet → run the Telnet client
localhost → connect to your own computer (127.0.0.1)
23 → port number 23 (Telnet service port)

Try to connect to the Telnet service on your own machine at port 23.
)

nc -zv localhost 23(
nc → Netcat (network tool)
-z → scan mode (do not send data, just check if port is open)
-v → verbose output (show details)
localhost → your own computer
23 → port number 23 (Telnet port)

Check if port 23 on your local machine is open, using Netcat with detailed output.
)

sudo ufw status numbered > ufw_rules.txt(
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → firewall tool
status numbered → show all firewall rules with numbers
> → redirect output to a file
ufw_rules.txt → the file where the output will be saved

Save the numbered UFW firewall rules into a file called ufw_rules.txt instead of showing them on the screen.
)

sudo ufw status numbered(
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → Uncomplicated Firewall
status numbered → display firewall rules with rule numbers

Show all UFW rules in a numbered list so you can refer to them easily (especially for deleting).
)

sudo ufw reset(
sudo → run as administrator
ufw → Uncomplicated Firewall
reset → restore UFW to its default settings

Completely reset the firewall: delete all rules, disable UFW, and return everything to default.
)
